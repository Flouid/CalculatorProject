This file is purely a list of ways that I could improve the calculator but go beyond the scope of a ti84


# add reciprocal trig functions (csc(), sec(), cot()...)
# represent answers in terms of constants like pi
# evaluate limits
# algebra solver


Here are things that I will need to approach in a novel way or I am not sure how I will implement


# functions like logBASE(), nDeriv(), fnInt()... etc use nonstandard notation and will need to be properly adapted
# 2nd and alpha modes?
# storing/dealing with variables
# graphing
# all the misc menus and functions it has, like the stats section or the math section etc
# PROGRAMMING!!!
